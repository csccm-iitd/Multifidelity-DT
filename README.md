# Enhanced_MFM_for_DT_UQ
Enhanced multi-fidelity modeling for digital twin and uncertainty quantification

The repository provides Matlab codes and the data files for the numerical examples illustrated in the paper ‘Enhanced multi-fidelity modeling for digital twin and uncertainty quantification.
Please go through the paper to understand the implemented algorithm.
Requirements:

1. Matlab latest version

2. Two significant applications of enhanced multi-fidelity modeling, Digital Twin and Uncertainty Quantification, are illustrated in the paper. The corresponding two case studies are uploaded in two separate folders named as
   ‘MFM_for_DT’,‘MFM_for_UQ’.

3. Data files required for the execution are provided in separate folders. Add the data path to run the main files to execute.
